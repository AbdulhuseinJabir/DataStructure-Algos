I have chosen to apply to PwC as I believe that my skill-set matches perfectly with the requirements of Pwc. Furthermore, the work environment at PwC will allow me to excel and deliver to my full potential.

“Dump the food up to the halfway mark in this bin and top it up with dry soil and hay! Don’t forget to put in the worms and water, and then let nature do its job!” This is our refrain, as my team mates and I transform yucky and smelly trash into a product that will nourish the plants in our school garden. 

This project is the brainchild of ‘The Environmentalists Club’ in our school, a club that I helped found.  The motivation for the club’s activities came from having constantly watched the poverty-stricken people in my homeland, India, scavenging for food under the scorching heat.  To these people, even one meal a day is a blessing.  This disturbs me every time I visit India, leaving me with a burning desire to do something, anything.

As a student, I asked myself what I could contribute?  Could I help raise money? Could I help raise awareness?  Would I be able to make a difference?  Living in Singapore, I could not provide any hands-on help for these people, except when I visited India during school vacations.  But, I did not want this fire to die out.  I channeled my efforts towards starting The Environmentalists Club in my school, whose focus would be on urging people to not waste food, and by inspiring them to understand the feelings of the ‘hungry’ around the world.  Even if we could not help such people directly, we could at least focus on reducing food waste in our school.

We decided to tap the energy in food waste, by creating compost pits in our school, allowing Mother Nature to cook her own nutritious food to nourish the soil.  We kicked into action by molding sheets of plastic into 10-foot deep bins, with holes drilled all over.  After installing these compost pits, the next uphill task was to urge students to throw organic food into the right bins.

Our efforts paid off over a period.  The soil is now enriched and has rewarded us by giving us healthy plants, for all of us to cherish and love.

My team mates and I walked frantically down the aisles of the mini-mart, our trolleys loaded with biscuits, fritters and everything edible. No, we were not hoarding for a fun-trip. In fact, we were there to avert a mini-crisis that had befallen us. 

My organisational abilities and diligence, probably cinched me the position of Head of Administration, (Secretariat) in the GIIS Model United Nations. Such designations are cool on badges, however I realized that the real test is in getting down to the tasks at hand. Especially with a team only comprising volunteers was not an easy feat. However, there were numerous positives like honing my diplomatic and negotiating skills with the school authorities and developing patience to repeatedly teach new entrants MUN protocols.

As Head of Administration, the baton of the school’s name and honor was passed on to me to conduct the GIIS-MUN event in a professional manner. But handling over 300 students, motivating the team, preparing budgets of expected costs and overseeing the logistics and conference management seemed like a gargantuan task broken down into thousands of mini tasks, all of which needed to be woven together into a seamless whole. 

This was when I learnt two important lessons – all the initial excitement and enthusiasm of the team led me to believe that everyone was motivated. This was my first mistake. As the event’s conception of a learning experience for students was being put into perspective, our planning started to go awry. In spite of having talented teammates, they lacked the initiative-taking ability. Members of the team started neglecting their duties, until the weight of responsibility started to fall on a few shoulders. As a leader, I had to act. I went to each individual, talked to them about their difficulties and reorganized the team in such a manner that one’s weakness was outweighed by another’s strength. I brought them all to the same page and introduced an award scheme from school for the most hardworking. This did spark some sort of enthusiasm in the team. I learnt that such issues can be solved by calmly thinking with a positive attitude.

The event began, and lesson number two was just waiting by the side-lines. The event’s opening ceremony, and lunch went smoothly, but as snack time approached, nothing seemed to go as planned. The caterers were extremely late in arriving and to top it all, the quantity of food brought-in was insufficient. We checked our records, and to our dismay, discovered that the caterers had signed the order only for 200 people. Costly mistake, and not the best time to point fingers. But we had no Plan B! Though it was a knee-jerk reaction, we headed straight to the nearest mini-mart for snacks and made it just in time.

As curtains fell on the last day, I looked back and learnt that having a Plan B is imperative and there is no substitute for micro-planning. Big events rest on the successful implementation of the smallest tasks.

Hey Sagar! I am Abdulhusein here! I do not think we have met before but I found your name within the CS2105 module listing. I am also doing it this semester. Actually I am from Engineering and do not know many people in SOC so just thought of writing to you so that we can keep in touch. 

Hey Vignesh! I am Abdulhusein here! I do not think we have met before but I found your name within the ME4231 module listing. I am also doing it this semester. I do not really know of many people doing the Aero spec so thought of writing in to you so that we can keep in touch. 

Hii Wei Yang! How have you been? The thing is I have taken CS2105 this sem and I am a little stuck with an Assignment in it. So do you have the assignment files you had submitted when you did this module? If yes, would it be okay if you can share with me those files so that I can refer to them as such?>

Dear Prof Roger Zimmermann, 
 
Personal Details:
Name – Abdulhusein Jabir Poonawala
Matric Number – A0177629M 
 
I am a Computer Science Minor student in NUS. I am currently in Year 4 and in my last semester of my undergraduate studies. 
 
During the module allocation, I tried extensively to be able to secure CS2105 Computer Network in all 3 rounds. However, I was unable to do so. 
 
Hence, I would like to request you that if there is a student who might drop this module in the coming 2 weeks, it would be great if you can help to allocate me this module. 
                                                                                                                                                                             
I do understand that since I am not from the Computing faculty directly, I am not given priority while taking this module. This might also be the reason as to why the Computing department directs me to take other modules in the Minor requirement basket. However, I would like to highlight that I am genuinely very interested in learning about Computer Networks. Furthermore, I can gain multiple advantages if I am able to learn the content taught in your module for my current FYP in engineering. Hence I would really appreciate if you can do help me out. Since this is my last semester in NUS, I would like to make it enriching and fruitful before I graduate.

I look forward to your kind support. 
 
Thank you, 
Abdulhusein
